# CS50x_Plurality
A program that runs a plurality election using random voting.
The program is based on Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Computer Science 2021 OpenCourseWare's problem set-3.

The program takes in user input for number of candidates (max. 5) and voters. It randomly selects the candidates from a predefined list of candidates viz. 'Lincoln', 'Kennedy', 'Bush', 'Obama', 'Trump', 'Biden'. The random voting is done for the input number of voters and votes are assigned to each candidate. The candidate(s) securing the most votes wins the election as per the "plurality vote".
